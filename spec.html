        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p class='lead'>
          CoAP is specified in a Standards-Track RFC.
          RFCs that serve as Internet Standards Documents are generated by the
          <a href='http://ietf.org'>IETF</a>
          based on an extensive technical review and quality control process.  These are meant to last.

          </h2>
          <p>The stable reference.</p>
          <p>
            Approved 2013-07-11 as draft-ietf-core-coap-18, it has been
            published as RFC 7252 on 2014-06-26 (the delay having been caused by waiting
            for some related security specifications to finish their
            publication process).

          <h2>IANA registry</h2>
          <p>
            CoAP has been designed to be extensible.
            Several registries are defined to enable evolution of the protocol over time.
            This includes response codes (such as 4.04 "Not found") and content-format values to indicate  media types (such as 50 for application/json).
            These are collected in an
            <a href='http://iana.org'>IANA</a>
            registry to ensure specifications are available and that they don't stumble over each others code points.

          <h2>Other specifications</h2>
          <p>
            Several other specifications work together to support using CoAP.
          </p>
          <h3>Link-format</h3>
          <p>
            <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690'>RFC 6690</a>
            defines the CoAP link-format, a simple format for exposing the
            resources offered by a CoAP server as the basis for a resource directory.
          </p>
          <h3>Group comm</h3>
          <p>
            Employing the basic multicast functionality defined in RFC 7252,
            <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7390'>RFC 7390</a>
            provides additional information and protocol flows for how to use CoAP for group communication.
          </p>
          <h3>OSCORE</h3>
          <p>
            <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8613'>RFC 8613</a>
            defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
            which is a protocol for applying application-layer protection to CoAP messages
            providing end-to-end security. The Java implementation of CoAP <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/californium/'>Californium</a>
            includes support for OSCORE.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class='span4'>
          <h2>Dependent specifications</h2>
          <p>CoAP is being picked up by other organizations as a normative reference for their standards.</p>
          
          <h3 id="lwm2m">LWM2M</h3>
          
          <p>On top of CoAP, the <a href="http://openmobilealliance.org/">Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)</a> has
          defined “Lightweight M2M” as a simple, low-cost
          remote management and service enablement mechanism.</p>
          
          <p><a class="btn" href="http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/oma-lightweightm2m-v1-0">View details »</a></p>
          
          <p>Besides a considerable number of commercial implementations,
          open-source implementations of the LWM2M standard are available
          for the <a href="http://eclipse.org/wakaama">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jvermillard/leshan">server</a> sides.
          Some basic testing support is also available on-line at <a href="http://coap.me">coap.me</a>.</p>
