        <h2>Specification</h2>
        <p class='lead'>
          CoAP is specified in a Standards-Track RFC.
          RFCs that serve as Internet Standards Documents are generated by the
          <a href='http://ietf.org'>IETF</a>
          based on an extensive technical review and quality control process.  These are meant to last.

          <p>The stable reference.</p>
          <p>
            Approved 2013-07-11 as draft-ietf-core-coap-18, it has been
            published in June 2014 (the delay having been caused by waiting
            for some related security specifications to finish their
            publication process).

          <h2>IANA registry</h2>
          <p>
            CoAP has been designed to be extensible.
            Several registries are defined to enable evolution of the protocol over time.
            This includes response codes (such as 4.04 "Not found") and content-format values to indicate  media types (such as 50 for application/json).
            These are collected in an
            <a href='http://iana.org'>IANA</a>
            registry to ensure specifications are available and that they don't stumble over each others code points.

          <h2>Other specifications</h2>
          <p>
            Several other specifications work together to support using CoAP.

          <h3>Link-format</h3>
          <p>
            <a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6690'>RFC 6690</a>
            defines the CoAP link-format, a simple format for exposing the
            resources offered by a CoAP server as the basis for a resource directory.
