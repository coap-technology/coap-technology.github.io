  <h2>CoAP Security</h2>
  <p class='lead'>
    The Internet of Things cannot spread as long as it can be exploited by hackers willy-nilly.
    CoAP does not just pay lip service to security, it actually provides strong security.
    The IETF is working on several security mechanisms.

      <a href='/sec/dtls.html'>Transport Layer Security (DTLS)</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The DTLS protocol provides communications
      privacy for datagram protocols. The protocol allows client/server
      applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent
      eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is
      based on the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IETF ACE working group is developing a standard that allows
   constrained servers to delegate client authentication and
   authorization, and set up a DTLS 1.2 channel between the entities.

    <h2>
      <a href='/sec/OSCORE.html'>Application Layer Security (OSCORE)</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      OSCORE provides end-to-end protection
      between endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP.
      OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a
      range of proxy operations, including translation between different
      transport protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
      OSCORE is extended with a mechanism to protect group communication using CoAP, called <a href='/sec/OSCORE.html#group-oscore'>Group OSCORE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IETF ACE working group is developing a standard that allows
   constrained servers to delegate client authentication and
   authorization, and set up OSCORE between the entities.

    <h2>Other security extensions</h2>
    <p>
      Several other specifications work together to support security in CoAP. Enhancements to CoAP that mitigate security issues in particular use
      cases are been developed.
    </p>
    <h3>Echo</h3>
    <p>
      The Echo option enables a CoAP server to verify the freshness
      of a request or to force a client to demonstrate reachability at its
      claimed network address; it is now the recommeded way to mitigate
      amplification attacks.
    </p>
    <h3>Request-Tag</h3>
    <p>
      The Request-Tag option allows the CoAP server
      to match <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7959'>block-wise message</a> fragments belonging to the same request.
    </p>
    <h3>Token Processing</h3>
    <p>
      The update to the client Token processing requirements of CoAP
      forbids non-secure reuse of Tokens to ensure binding of responses to
      requests when CoAP is used with security.
